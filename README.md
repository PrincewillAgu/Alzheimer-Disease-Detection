# Alzheimer-Disease-Detection

The aim of this project is to use features extracted from MRI images, together with additional data, retrieved from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/ and www.adni-info.org) to classify the healthy cognitive normal (CN) subjects and patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD)

These features come from a number of healthy cognitively normal (CN) subjects and patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).
